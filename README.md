Titled officially as "Determining Neural Region of Interests' Relationship to Cognitive Impairment 
Symptoms Using Tau Scans", this Github repo serves as an extension of our final project from the 
Fall 2023 edition of the Stanford University course PSYC 221: Machine Learning for Neuroimaging 
(ML4N). The purpose of this project extends from our shared interest in the improvement of
predictions with regards to Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
